## General Introduction

Traffic jams are annoying situations everyone knows. However it is not always obvious how they arise. To better understand the factors playing a role and to understand, what has to be done in order to avoid more and bigger traffic jams is therefore a interesting and demanding question.
Especially the so called "start-stop waves" are of a bigger interest for us, and the factors influencing them.

## The Model

We will start from the Nagel-Schreckenberg model, which is a cellular automaton model for road traffic flow. 
It shows nicely how traffic jams can arise due too crowded highways.
We will then examine influence of the considered factors: 
> * velocity of the cars 
> * distance to other cars
> * randomized behavior (eg. dawdling)

Finally we will expand the model and examine the influence of the average speed of the traffic partipicants.

Simplyfied highway traffic works after only few rules: A driver decides how fast to go, influenced by the speed limit, distance to cars in front of him, and some random dawdling (acceleration and driving speed may depend on the drivers mood or sleepiness). Therefore a cellular automaton model fits this problem especially well.

We will however not consider motorway exits etc.


## Fundamental Questions

> * How does average driven speed and max allowed speed influence the arising of traffic jams?
> * How should drivers bahave (accelerate, hold distance, etc) to reduce the likelihood of a traffic jam?



## Expected Results

It is expected, that higher driving speeds and broader driving speed distributions increases the likelihood of traffic jams.
Furthermore nervous drivers, changing their speed a lot, should also result in more traffic jams.
