- toddling more likely if you go slow and the more unlikely the faster you go
- else toddling will not have a big effect, because drivers will always close up to a traffic jam or drive away with the same probabiltiy p
-> if you drive slow already you try to save energy and wait a little longer till you accelerate again - if on the other hand you are really fast, you wanna keep your speed and dont want to slow down

- change start stop waves from moving forward to moving backwards by changeing the deceleration paramter from >1 to 1.

- instead of anticipatory -> consider own velocity (makes more sense)

- combine most realistic properties of different approaches

- velocity distribution = gaussian?
