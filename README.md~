# MATLAB Fall 2015 – Research Plan

> * Group Name: Traffic_jam_simulations
> * Group participants names: Jorit Schmelzle, Shin Watanabe
> * Project Title: Nagel–Schreckenberg model

## General Introduction

Traffic jams are annoying situations everyone knows. However it is not always obvious how they arise. To better understand the factors playing a role and to understand, what has to be done in order to avoid more and bigger traffic jams is therefore a interesting and demanding question.
Especially the so called "start-stop waves" are of a bigger interest for us, and the factors influencing them.

## The Model

We will start from the Nagel-Schreckenberg model, which is a cellular automaton model for road traffic flow. 
It shows nicely how traffic jams can arise due too crowded highways.
We will then examine the factors considered: 
> * velocity of the cars 
> * distance to other cars
> * randomized behavior (eg. dawdling)

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)


## References 

(Add the bibliographic references you intend to use)
(Explain possible extension to the above models)

## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)
